Introduction to Fractal Theory
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ergreen/honors_thesis/fractal.html

What is a fractal? In the most generalized terms, a fractal demostrates a limit. Fractals model complex physical processes 
and dynamical systems. The underlying principle of fractals is that a simple process that goes through infinitely many 
iterations becomes a very complex process. Fractals attempt to model the complex process by searching for the simple process underneath.

Most fractals operate on the principle of a feedback loop. A simple operation is carried out on a piece of data and
then fed back in again. This process is repeated infinitely many times. The limit of the process produced is the fractal.

Almost all fractals are at least partially self-similar. This means that a part of the fractal is identical to the entire 
fractal itself except smaller.
